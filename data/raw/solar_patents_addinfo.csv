A vacuum system is employed to pick up the cell from the separation point place to the feeder point. A set of thin air jets is used to separate the wafers from sticking to each other. A pre-aligning system equipped with pneumatic cylinders position the cells so that the cells are fed to the printing machine precisely in orientation to the print screen. Two numbers of magazines are used to facilitate bulk loading of wafers up to 1400 numbers of wafers at a time. Also two numbers of servomotors are employed to position the wafers in the magazine to enable the vacuum cups pick up the wafers at a fixed height consistently.","AUTOMATED SEPARATION AND FEEDING SYSTEM FOR WAFERS OF SOLAR CELLS FOR SCREEN PRINTING MACHINE IN SOLAR CELL PRODUCTION LINE","BHARAT HEAVY ELECTRICALS LTD","bharat","bharat",1,1,"55-776-4390",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"P O BOX 1948:112RUWI","Not Available","MUSCAT",NA,NA,"OMAN",24810502,NA,24810526,NA,"Not Available",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"ELECTRICAL APPARATUS AND EQUIPMENT, NSK",0,"No",0,"Import & Export","Non-Subsidiary","No",NA,NA,"Public",0,"Rent","No",NA,NA,155,155,0,NA,"Single Location",NA,NA,2361354000,5859411000,"$35,081,615","$0","N/A","N/A",NA,50630000,423610,NA,"1","2008","2010",13,"H01L31/18",1,"bharat","Cells","Crystalline Silicon Cells","General","H01L31/18","",NA,"","","","",NA,"","",""

By following the process, a variety of CZTS material with variable levels of zinc and tin atomic ratio in the CZTS compound can rapidly be prepared. The synthesized CZTS powders have tetragonal kesterite structure with specific surface area in the range of 70 + 5 m2/g. Heat treatment (annealing) of the CZTS powder in any inert atmosphere, e.g., argon or nitrogen at a temperature in the range of 100 - 300°C improves the crystallinity of CZTS powder since as-synthesized CZTS powders are poorly crystalline. Electron microscopy analyses (TEM & Fe-SEM) of the CZTS powder show the nanostructure in the material with primary particles in the range of 10 - 50 nanometers and is suitable for photovoltaic applications for forming light absorption layer either by coating or printing the CZTS material following any standard procedure.","A NON-VACUUM CHEMICAL PROCESS FOR RAPID SYNTHESIS OF NANOSTRUCTURED CZTS POWDERS FOR SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAIC APPLICATIONS","BHARAT HEAVY ELECTRICALS LTD","bharat","bharat",1,1,"55-776-4390",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"P O BOX 1948:112RUWI","Not Available","MUSCAT",NA,NA,"OMAN",24810502,NA,24810526,NA,"Not Available",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"ELECTRICAL APPARATUS AND EQUIPMENT, NSK",0,"No",0,"Import & Export","Non-Subsidiary","No",NA,NA,"Public",0,"Rent","No",NA,NA,155,155,0,NA,"Single Location",NA,NA,2361354000,5859411000,"$35,081,615","$0","N/A","N/A",NA,50630000,423610,NA,"1","2014","2015",30,"H01L31/00",1,"bharat","Combined","Combinations of the groups above","General","H01L31/00","",NA,"","","","",NA,"","",""

The safe and non-toxic sulfur hexafluoride and oxygen (SF6 & O2) reactant gases, under the influence of RF (13.56 MHz) or VHF (70 MHz) power, in a narrow band of process conditions, create micro masks giving rise to selective etching of the multicrystalline silicon surface. This leads to the formation of randomly distributed nano structures giving black look to the silicon surface irrespective of the crystal orientation. These nano structures are found to exhibit enhanced light trapping property when their dimensions are comparable to or larger than the wavelengths of the incident sunlight leading to substantial improvement in the efficiency of mc-Si solar cells. As a preparatory step, viz., conventional alkali etching solution was used for saw damage removal. This was considered necessary for initiating texturization process by RIE on defect free surface for emitter formation. The sample wafers were mounted on the specially designed carrier / jig to form grounded electrode required to inflict minimum damage for maintaining device quality wafer surface. Reactant gases were subjected to medium RF power to minimize RIE induced surface damage. An acidic etching solution, called Damage Removal Etch (DRE) was used to ensure totally damage free surface. The overall effect of enhanced light trapping and cell area enhancement due to RIE texturization lead to an absolute improvement in efficiency of 125 mm sq mc-Si solar cell up to 2.4%. The maximum efficiency of the cell with and without RIE were observed to be 15.1% and 12.7%, respectively, when processed under identical conditions.","IMPROVEMENT IN EFFICIENCY OF MULTICRYSTALLINE SILICON SOLAR CELLS USING SELF-MASKING AND LOW-ENERGY REACTIVE LON ETCHING (RIE) PROCESS FOR TEXTURIZATION.","BHARAT HEAVY ELECTRICALS LTD","bharat","bharat",1,1,"55-776-4390",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"P O BOX 1948:112RUWI","Not Available","MUSCAT",NA,NA,"OMAN",24810502,NA,24810526,NA,"Not Available",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"ELECTRICAL APPARATUS AND EQUIPMENT, NSK",0,"No",0,"Import & Export","Non-Subsidiary","No",NA,NA,"Public",0,"Rent","No",NA,NA,155,155,0,NA,"Single Location",NA,NA,2361354000,5859411000,"$35,081,615","$0","N/A","N/A",NA,50630000,423610,NA,"1","2007","2008",54,"H01L31/00",1,"bharat","Combined","Combinations of the groups above","General","H01L31/00","",NA,"","","","",NA,"","",""

Then, the passivating dielectric layer is locally removed in regions of busbars and local contact points. Thereafter, the rear side of the celt is homogenously coated for the formation of an unstructured thin metallic layer. The thin metallic layer makes contact with a surface of a substrate material in regions that are free of the passivating dielectric layer. Further, a thick layer made of a conductive paste is created in the regions of the busbars and the local contact points. The thick layer is sintered at a temperature above a predetermined eutectic temperature.
