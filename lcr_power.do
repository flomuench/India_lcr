	* influence on power
		* common support --> N in TG & CG
			* assumption: 90% in TG, 66% in CG
		* matching result --> SD in TG & CG
			* assumption: matching should remove firms without patent
				* and thus increase SD in CG close to SD in TG
	
	* outcome variable: mean & SD
		* patents
			* Howell 2017: 
				* descriptive statistics, table 1 p. 5
					* pre: mean =  1.9, SD = 7.5 
					* post: mean =  2, SD = 11
				* treatment effect (p. 9): 
					*"phase 1 award increased cite-weighted patents 2.5 times" (nbreg)
					*"phas 1 award increased cite-weighted patents 30%" (OLS)
	
	
	* measures:
		* sample size
		* MDE
			* what could we expect?
				* how much more did the Indian government pay?
				* how high are sales per patent for sample companies?

/* 
Given we currently only dispose the number of patent filed per company
as outcome data, we focus power size calculations on patents. Existing
research about LCR is exclusively qualitative in nature and draws conclusions
about LCR effectiveness based on expert interviews rather than firm-level data,
which is why we cannot use results from previous literature for power calculations.
Instead, we use a recent, quasi-experimental evaluation of the US Department
of Energy Small Business Innovation Research program that consists of
mostly of R&D grants for proof-of-concept frontier innovation in emerging 
energy technologies, such as notably solar (Howell, 2017). While the US context
is certainly not comparable to low-income countries, comparing LCR to what
would have possible through a popular, alternative policy, namely R&D support
