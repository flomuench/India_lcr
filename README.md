You can download the latest draft by simply clicking on it.

You find all the do-files in the "do-file" folder. "lcr_master.do" is the do-file which executes all other do-files.
Given the data is not yet published, I only provide access to the do-files for transparency purposes. Once the work is published,
I will also provide replication data.
